# My-Resume-HNGX
Welcome to the HNGX Resume App, a mobile application designed to help you create and showcase your professional resume with ease. This app is developed as part of the HNGX Internship program.

## Task Given: Mobile CV Application
## Objective:
Develop and design a mobile application serving as a comprehensive CV, showcasing personal and professional details. The app should enable both viewing and editing of the provided CV information.

## Requirements:
### Personal Information:
The application should display:
- Your full name
- Slack username
- GitHub handle
- A brief personal bio
### Home/First Page (CV View):
This will be the initial screen users encounter upon opening the app.
It will come pre-filled with your aforementioned details.
Craft this page in a clean and organized manner to present the CV information clearly.
### Editing Capability:
Include a dedicated page or screen for editing the CV particulars.
This editing page should offer user-friendly fields or sections for modifying the existing CV data.
### Real-time Updates:
After making changes to the CV details, returning to the home/first page should immediately reflect the alterations.
Ensure the app updates dynamically without requiring manual refresh.
## Acceptance Criteria:
- Legibility: All content within the application, particularly on the home/first page, must be legible, easy to read, and well-structured.
- Multi-screen Application: The application should encompass at least two distinct screens or pages - the primary CV viewing page and the editing page.
- No Third-party Dependencies: Develop the application exclusively using the native capabilities of the mobile platform, without integrating any third-party tools, packages, plugins, or libraries.
- Documentation: Incorporate a README.md file in your repository, providing clear setup instructions, an overview of the application, its functionalities, and any other pertinent details.
